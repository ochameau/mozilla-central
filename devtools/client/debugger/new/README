Building debugger from sources:
1) Checkout GitHub sources:
   $ ./copy-from-github.sh
This script creates a "github" and "src" folders.
This checkouts julian's "branch-name" branch that I rebased to a recent github revision.
"github" is a complete checkout of github repo, that is not meant to land in m-c,
while "src" are files that need to be transpile by babel into the objdir. It is the debugger sources.

3) Create the moz.build files in "src" folder:
   $ cd github
   $ yarn
   $ node bin/create-mozbuild.js src/
Once `mach` integration is validated, we can land these moz.build files in GitHub
and maintain them manually, as we do in mozilla-central.

4) Update vendors bundle:
   $ cd github
   $ node bin/copy-assets.js --mc ../../../../../
Ideally, this step would also go away and use only babel.

5) $ ./mach build!
